## 1. Netflix Acquiring Warner Bros. (from WBD)

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | ✅ APPROVED BY WBD BOARD (Pending regulatory approval & shareholder vote) |
| **Deal Value** | $82.7 billion enterprise value ($72 billion equity) |
| **Announced** | December 5, 2025 |
| **Expected Close** | Late 2026 / Early 2027 (after Discovery Global spin-off in Q3 2026) |

### What Netflix Gets:

> ⚠️ **Key Note:** Paramount Skydance launched a hostile $108B counter-bid for ALL of WBD, but the WBD board rejected it on January 7, 2026, calling it "insufficient value."

## What This Means for Documentary Filmmakers

### Shrinking Buyers:
- HBO Max will eventually be absorbed into Netflix (one less independent buyer)
- MTV Documentary Films in restructuring limbo under Ellison regime
- Paramount priorities shifting away from streaming films

### Windows of Opportunity:
- **HBO Max Ireland launch (March 2026)** creates demand for local content
- Netflix becoming even more dominant = potentially more commissioning budget
- Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video remain independent alternatives
- BBC/PBS co-productions still a strong path for UK/Ireland content

---

## Key Contacts & Resources

### HBO Max (Pre-Netflix Acquisition)
- Launching in Ireland: March 2026
- Distribution partner: Sky Ireland
- Look for commissioning announcements in Q1 2026

### Netflix
- Documentary division actively acquiring
- Will inherit HBO Documentary Films post-merger

### BBC / PBS Co-Productions
- Strong track record with Northern Ireland content
- Recent example: *Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland* (BBC Two + PBS)
- Northern Ireland Screen offers funding support

### Apple TV+

- Recent: *Bono: Stories of Surrender* (2025)
